       During the four-week reporting period from 9 December 2024 to 5 January 2025, weekly SARS-CoV-2 PCR percent test positivity changed from 8.5% in the beginning week of the reporting period to 8.1% in the last week, as detected in integrated sentinel and systematic virological surveillance within the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). During this period, an average of 59 114 specimens across 108 countries were tested for SARS-CoV-2 each week.

        The World Health Organization is monitoring several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including one variant of interest (VOI) JN.1, and seven variants under monitoring (VUMs). JN.1, the VOI, accounted for 15.0% of sequences in week 1 of 2025. The VUM, XEC and LP.8.1 continue to increase in prevalence, accounting for 44.8% and 4.7%, respectively, of sequences in week 1 of 2025, and are the only tracked variants currently growing in prevalence. All the remaining VUMs are declining in prevalence.
        
        Twenty-four (10%) countries reported COVID-19 deaths, and 79 (34%) countries reported COVID-19 cases globally during the 28-day period from 9 December 2024 to 5 January 2025. According to the data provided, over 161 000 new cases were reported during the 28-day period, representing a 21% decrease in the number of reported cases. At the same time, around 3300 new deaths were reported, representing a 14% increase in new deaths compared to the previous 28-day period (11November to 8 December 2024).
        
        During the same period, hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions were reported at least once in 37 (16%) and 28 (12%) countries, respectively. Approximately 14,600 new hospitalizations and 1000 new intensive care unit admissions were recorded based on the data that was available. New hospitalizations increased by 10% while ICU admissions stayed unchanged among the countries that consistently reported these data over the past and previous reporting periods.
